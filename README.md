# About
This is a visualizer for the A* pathfinding algorithm. Its a small program ment to demonstrate how the algorithm works.

# requirement
Install ***pygame*** if you don't already have it! The easiest way is through the command prompt you can type either of the two below.
<br>
pip install pygame **or** pip3 install pygame
<br>
copy and paste if you want and if that doesn't work make sure your pip is working properly.

## Controls

***Left Click*** changes the nodes from white to start, end, or barrier. If start and end doesn't exist yet it will make it first
<br>
***Right Click*** resets the nodes back to there default state
<br>
***Space*** starts the pathfinding algorithm
<br>
***R*** resets all the squares
# Notes
- Once the algorithm starts you can't hit a button until it finishs. 

- Pygame has a tendency to crash during lengthy processing times to prevent this don't drag the window while it is running or select another application.
